  <h1>Temperature Data: US Data</h1>

  <p>In 2006 all of the states & or cities temperatures were above freezing.
    <strong></strong></p>
  <p>
    
  </p>The average temperature during 2006 in all of these places was 46 degrees
  <p>
    
  </p>The average temperatures were 40, 34, 51, 34, and 69 degrees in 2006
  <p>
    The median in this data set is 40 which means that all the temperatures in the data set were above freezing
  </p>
  <p>
   In red the 2007 temperatures in the blue are the 2006 ones, clearly the ones in 2006 are higher (above freezing), this shows how in 2006 it had high temperatures and in 2007 there were more temperatures below freezing 
  </p>
  <p>
    With all of this said the temperature in the states of my data were above freezing.
